%% System Requirements
% MEALPix is a native Matlab(TM) implementation of HEALPix: neither a
% HEALPix installation nor any third-party java or mex files are required
% to make use of the basic HEALPix functionality. 

%% Matlab(TM) requirements
% MEALPix was developed and tested using Matlab(TM) R2010a. It should work
% with any later version. 
%
% MEALPix does not require any Mathworks(TM) Toolboxes or add-ons. MEALPix
% will make use of the capabilities of the
% <http://www.mathworks.com/products/parallel-computing/ Parallel Computing
% Toolbox>, should it be present.  

%% Third-party software requirements
% MEALPix also includes functions not found in HEALPix. Some of these
% additional functions require other toolboxes: 
%
% * <hammer_help.html |hammer|> requires the
% <http://www.eos.ubc.ca/~rich/map.html M_MAP> Toolbox.

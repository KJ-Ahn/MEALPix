%% Installation
% * Download MEALPix, which is provided as a gzipped tar file. Un-tar the
% file and place the MEALPix directory in some appropriate location.
% Hereafter we will refer to the fully-qualified path to MEALPix as
% |$MEALPIX|. 
%
% * Add the MEALPix directory tree to your Matlab(TM) path using, e.g., the
% Matlab(TM) command |addpath(genpath('$MEALPIX'))|. You may wish to add
% this command to your matlab/startup.m file, in which case MEALPix will be
% available whenever you start-up Matlab(TM). 
%
% The MEALPix Toolbox includes documentation that will appear in the Matlab
% Documentation browser when Matlab(TM) starts-up with MEALPix in its path.
